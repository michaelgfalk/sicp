# SICP

My solutions to the exercises in [The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf).

Before completing *SICP*, I knew no Scheme/LISP. This was my way to learn the language as well as improve my understanding of program design.

I've tried to work these out on my own. No guarantees they are all elegant or correct. Occasionally I have consulted online solutions, but have replicated them on my own when I can.

Sometimes I 'cheat' by using features of the language that haven't been introduced yet in the text. This is because I watched all [the lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE18841CABEA24090) first.
